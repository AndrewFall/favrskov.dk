Pane Hearing Responses
======================

Each hearing contains a list of responses in table style. 
This module showing the latest 10 responses with paging.

It is  possible to filter the responses via one ore more select fields above the response table.

It could be done by checking  “Use for filtering” checkbox on select fields.

Using Views for this is  to complex so it is custom code.
